## Employee Corruption Detection
### Overview

This repository contains a project aimed at identifying potential corrupt employees based on discrepancies in the data from the Incorrect_records table. By analyzing employee records and isolating suspicious patterns, we aim to generate reports that can be used for further investigation or action.

### Objective

The goal of this project is to create a systematic approach to:

    Identify employees whose records contain errors or inconsistencies.
    Analyze data patterns that may point to corrupt practices.
    Produce a list of potentially corrupt employees for further auditing.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

    -Python 3.8+
    -Jupyter Notebook
    -Pandas
    -Numpy
    -Matplotlib (for visual analysis, optional)

You can install the required libraries by running:

*pip install -r requirements.txt*

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the project up and running, run:

**git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-corruption-detection.git**
**cd employee-corruption-detection.**

### 2. Data Preparation

Ensure that the Incorrect_records.csv file is placed in the data/ folder. This CSV file should contain the necessary employee data for analysis, including:

    -Employee IDs
    -Error types
    -Transaction records
    -Dates of discrepancies

### 3. Running the Analysis

You can either run the analysis directly in the Jupyter notebook or execute the Python script:

    -Open notebooks/Analysis.ipynb to follow the step-by-step process.
    -Alternatively, run the following command to execute the script:

       **python scripts/data_analysis.py**

### 4. Interpreting Results

The analysis will generate a list of potentially corrupt employees based on a threshold of anomalies. These employees will be flagged for further investigation.
Customization

You can modify the thresholds and criteria for identifying corrupt employees in the configuration file (config.yaml). For example, you can adjust:

    -The minimum number of errors to flag an employee.
    -The severity of discrepancies.
